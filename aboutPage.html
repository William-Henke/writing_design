        <p id="blurb">I am currently an undergraduate at Whitworth University. I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science. In addition, I am <br> contemplating a minor in engineering becuase that could beneficial in the tech industry. By expanding my knowledge of <br> technology, I hope to make the world a more thoughtful, inclusive, and safe place for everyone.</p>

                <div id="reading">
                    <p>Two of my favorite passtimes are baking and reading. I find baking to be a great way to destress and take my mind off <br> of whatever might be bothering me. So far I have only had time to make banana bread but I hope to bake lots more as soon <br> as I have some free time. Most of what I've learned about baking is from my dad who worked in a bakery in Colorado <br> whenever he had time off from school. I enjoy reading for the same reasons I like baking. Science fiction or fantasy books/novels <br> are some of my favorites. Reading can take you into a different world where you can live a different life or experience things that will <br> never really happen. Being able to experience what other people do or how they think is a great tool for understanding others. <br> Someday I would like to write a novel or book inspired by all the different things Iâ€™ve read. </p>

        <h1 id="last-stuff">Early coding experience</h1>
        <p id="last-stuff2">In my sophomore year of high school I was introduced to the Computing For All initiative (also known as Digital Skills Youth Academy). <br> 
        This program taught me everything I know about technology and careers in the tech field. Over the span of two and a half years I learned how <br> 
        about web languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as programing languages like Python. In addition, DSYA afforded me many <br> opportunities to visit, job shadow, and even intern at companies like Smartsheet, Facebook, Tableau, and many others. If you have any interest <br> in coding please check out their website listed below.</p>
